So you want to contribute to Lumol and create the next generation of
molecular simulation engine? Great! This document tries to explain how you can
contribute, but in case of doubt do not hesitate to contact me at
luthaf@luthaf.fr.

# Bug reports and feature requests

Bug and feature requests should be reported as [Github
issue](https://github.com/lumol-org/lumol/issues/new). For bugs, you should
provide information so that we can reproduce it: what did you try? What did you
expect? What happened instead? Please provide any useful code snippet or input file
with your bug report.

# Area of contribution

A lot of contributions can be made to Lumol, and most of them do not involve
writing code:

- Improving the documentation and help with language issues;
- Testing the code on your systems to find bugs;
- Providing feedback on the interface;
- Adding new potentials;
- Adding new simulation algorithm;

All these contributions are very welcome. I accept contributions either via
Github pull request (have a look
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for Github model
of pull request); or you can send me patches by email at luthaf@luthaf.fr.

If you want to work on the code and pick something easy to get started, have a look at the
[Level:Easy](https://github.com/lumol-org/lumol/labels/L%3AEasy) issues.

If you want to add a new feature to Lumol, please create an issue so that we
can discuss it, and you have more chances to see your changes incorporated.
