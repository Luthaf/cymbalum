System
******

A ``System`` contains all the data about the physical system we are simulating.
It contains four types of data:

-  A list of **Particles**, which are physical objects, with a position, a
   velocity, a mass and a name;
-  A list of **Molecules** containing information about how the particles are
   bounded together;
-  An **UnitCell**, *i.e.* the bounding box of the simulation.
-  **Interactions**, sometimes called a force field.

Unit cells
----------

Lumol knows about three types of unit cells:

-  Infinite cells do not have any boundaries, and can be used to simulate
   systems in vacuum;
-  Orthorhombic cells have up to three independent lengths, and all the angles
   of the cell are set to 90Â°;
-  Triclinic cells have 6 independent parameters: 3 lengths and 3 angles.

Orthorhombic and Triclinic cells are used in combination with `periodic boundary
conditions <pbc_>`_ to simulate infinite systems.

Interactions
------------

Interactions associate a potential and some particles kind. Lumol provides code
for various potentials types:

-  Non-bonding pair potentials;
-  Bonds potentials in molecules;
-  Angles potentials in molecules;
-  Dihedral angles potentials in molecules;
-  Long-ranges coulombic potentials (Ewald and Wolf methods);
-  Arbitrary external potential applying on the whole system at once.
