Units
=====

Lumol features a set of internal units and offers facilities to convert
from and to this set of internal units.

The internal unit system is the following: - Angstrom (``A``) for
distances; - Femtosecond (``fs``) for time; - Unified atomic mass unit
(``u`` or ``Da``) for mass; - Kelvin (``K``) for temperature; - Number
of particles for quantity of matter; - Radian (``rad``) for angles;

Any other internal unit is derived from this set: - The internal unit of
energy is ``u A^2 fs^-2``; - The internal unit of force is
``u A fs^-2``; - The internal unit of pressure is ``u A^-1 fs^-2``; -
*etc.*

Lumol knows how to convert any value in these internal unit to others
units. The accepted units are:

In the input files, the units are specified as strings, and must be
spelled exactly as in the above table. They can be combined with other
units using ``*`` for multiplication, ``/`` for division, and ``^`` for
exponents. Parentheses can be used to group sub-units together. Some
valid unit strings are ``kcal/mol``, ``(J / mol) * A^-2``, and
``m*fs^-1``.
